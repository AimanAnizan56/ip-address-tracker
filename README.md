# React (SWC) + TypeScript + Vite

This project is made by using Vite tools with React JS framework. Tailwind CSS was used as responsive styling for the website with custom configuration. IP Geolocation API from IPify has been utilized to get the IP location of the client.

Currently, Speedy Web Compiler (SWC) is used to provide faster compilation and refresh:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
